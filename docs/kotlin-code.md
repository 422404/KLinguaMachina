The parser, the compiler and the interpreter will be coded in Kotlin as we don't do JIT.
- In the future, compiler and interpreter might be rewritten in Lingua Machina as an experiment

All classes are defined in Lingua Machina but primitive methods are written in Kotlin.
- A special kind of method definition is done, referencing built-in implementation
  (see [Kotlin Interface](kotlin-interface.md))
